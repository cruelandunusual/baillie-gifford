## About me

I am an experienced video editor looking to develop my career further with an oppportunity... I am seeking a role in an organisation that will offer me development opportunities and career progression, and I believe Baillie Gifford will give me those opportunities.

## Experience / Technical and Professional skills

`I have been a filmmaker for over twenty years, initially as a freelancer, producing and directing music videos and documentaries for music industry clients`<sup>should this be changed? On first reading it might sound like editing is just something I do among other filmmaking activities, not the primary thing I do</sup>; from 2008 until 2024 I was a full-time in-house agency editor, where I primarily worked on corporate communications for both public and private sector clients such as the NHS, Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise, Lloyds Banking Group, Edinburgh University, Newton Investment Management, among many others.  
Since being made redundant in late 2024 I have taken a career break, but continued to hone my editing skills with a [self-directed project](https://linkhere.com) editing a drama from [EditStock footage](https://editstock.com/).


## Critical Skills  
### Adaptability  
I am comfortable identifying knowledge gaps in my own understanding, and am willing to adapt to new ways of working. Throughout my career I have consistently sought new learning opportunities; for example, I have never formally studied film making, I learned by doing; while I gained initial training from a volunteer position in Glasgow, my editing skills were primarily learned on the job, and further honed from listening to feedback from peers and mentors.  

Additionally, over the years I have taught myself motion graphics techniques as well as sound design and basic music composition.  

However, no one learns in a vacuum, and I recognise that I gained an enormous amount from a strong network of peers and mentors; I also have experience of having been a mentor to a younger colleague while at Republic Productions, and I grew personally and professionally from that experience also.  

Aside from my creative editing skills, I have a strong technical skillset from my background in IT. Throughout my video editing career I actively integrated coding into workflows; I automated motion graphics in After Effects with JavaScript; I wrote Python scripts in Blender 3D to animate mesh objects; and I wrote Bash scripts to generate disk usage reports of a 70TB Linux-based RAID storage network while at Speakeasy Productions.  

My role at Republic Productions involved maintaining the IT systems of the company; I managed a small network of Windows machines, remotely installing upgrades and security patches. At Speakeasy Productions I was involved in gaining Cyber Essentials certification.  


### Storytelling
Having edited professionally for 20 years, I am a highly adaptable editor with a flexible approach, and I have a huge range of experience across various genres and formats: [long form documentary](OceansofValue); [drama](KentCountyCouncil-FraudandFinancialAbuse); [event opening films](Newton2021-Eventopeningfilm); [bespoke technical presentations](NewtonPresentation2024-Jason); and [monthly magazine-style reportage](LBG-CustomerFirsttv-Risk).  

I have often had to work quickly to very tight deadlines, occasionally turning a project around in a single day. I am very experienced at juggling multiple projects and prioritising my workload accordingly.<sup>I have a statement about this in an old CV; copy it from there?</sup>  

I feel I have a strength for cutting interviews; when the material allows, I endeavour to intercut the participants in such a way that they seamlessly flowing from one speaker to the next.  

when different participants are in agreement with each other I endeavour to cut between them in such a way that it feels like they are speaking with one voice. [This video](NESMobileSkillsUnitTestimonial) illustrates the technique well - a transcript of this video might read as though one person was speaking on the topic, which is appropriate given that all the speakers give equally effusive praise of the MSU service. [This is another example](SCTS-PrisonSentencing), and [this](NapierInnovationHub-Cogmhear).


* Napier Coghmear for onbrand graphics
* prison sentencing for finishing sentences -- or mobile skills unit, since there's nothing else about that that's noteworthy. prison sentencing can be used for bespoke music



`to do:`  
* examples of music  
* graphics  
* sound effects  

`Make sure to tie these examples in to the skills mentioned in the job description  - use their terminology, e.g. the SE Annual Review needs the phrase 'problem-solving skills / think quickly`  


### Team working  
I have strong written and speaking communication skills and am always conscious of my audience and their level of technical expertise.  

Having made videos for a variety of clients from different industries and sectors, I have demonstrated a strong ability to quickly absorb and understand information relating to subjects where I have limited or non-specialist knowledge. Because of this, I feel I am particularly capable of distilling and communicating complex information to wide audiences.  

Additionally, an essential part of the role of an editor is listening to and implementing feedback from clients, team members and other stakeholders, which has taught me the value of listening to all contributions.  

In my previous role at Speakeasy Productions, and also from my time as a software developer at Agilent in Germany, I have gained valuable experience working across multi-disciplinary teams, and in teams with colleagues whose first language wasn't English. In particular, at Agilent each member of my development team took turns to host our team meetings, which required clear communication, patient and respectful interactions with colleagues, and encouraged me to express ideas using jargon-free language. I also on occasion hosted these meetings in German.  

## Summary

I believe I would be a good fit for Baillie Gifford; I am highly motivated, adaptable, and eager to continue growing in my career. I thrive in supportive, collaborative team environments where the work is both varied and challenging, and I aspire to be a supportive, positive colleague.
