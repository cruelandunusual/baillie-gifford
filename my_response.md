## About me

I am an experienced video editor looking to develop my career further with an oppportunity to help . I am seeking a role in an organisation that will offer me development opportunities and career progression, and I believe Baillie Gifford will give me those opportunities.

## Experience / Technical and Professional skills  

---  

I am a skilled and creative editor with 16 years experience of collaborative working in a production environment and seven years of freelance experience before that.  
I have cut dramas, interview-led corporate case studies, long-form documentaries, short social media clips, animations, audio-only podcasts, and lots more.  
I am used to working in a fast-paced environment to challenging deadlines.  
I have worked alongside directors and producers in the edit suite, as well as with clients on many occasions.  I am equally comfortable working on my own initiative, whether from a detailed brief or a loose idea. 
I have vast experience of all aspects of the post-production pipeline: from ingesting and logging footage, to editing, colour correction and sound mastering, and archiving and retrieving projects to and from long-term storage.  
I am highly experienced with both Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro, and also have experience of DaVinci Resolve and Avid Media Composer. I am very comfortable with After Effects and Adobe Audition, having used both extensively throughout my career, and am also experienced with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and the Microsoft Office suite.  
I also have years of experience of directing, producing, camera operating and location sound recording.  
I have strong technical skills, with wide experience of all major video and audio formats. I am comfortable with all operating systems and have experience of batch scripting and automation of tasks.  
I value working in a supportive and positive environment, and constantly strive to achieve the best results possible in my work. I am a fast learner, have excellent communication skills, and am strongly motivated to continue learning and growing in my career.

> For instance, this video for Scottish Enterprise was edited in a single (long) night; I repurposed the visuals from a previous brief together with stock footage.  
>`I have often had to work quickly to very tight deadlines, occasionally turning a project around in a single day. I am very experienced at juggling multiple projects and prioritising my workload accordingly.`<sup>I have a statement about this in an old CV; copy it from there?</sup>  
>I can work from a detailed client brief and am also comfortable working entirely on my own initiative, using my many years experience to guide and shape edits.  

> `I have been a filmmaker for over twenty years, initially as a freelancer, producing and directing music videos and documentaries for music industry clients`<sup>should this be changed? On first reading it might sound like editing is just something I do among other filmmaking activities, not the primary thing I do</sup>; from 2008 until 2024 I was a full-time in-house agency editor, where I primarily edited corporate communications for both public and private sector clients such as the NHS, Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise, Lloyds Banking Group, Edinburgh University, Newton Investment Management, among many others.  
>Since being made redundant in late 2024 I have taken a career break, but continued to hone my editing skills with a [self-directed project](https://linkhere.com) editing a drama from [EditStock footage](https://editstock.com/).

## Critical Skills  
### Adaptability  
I am comfortable identifying knowledge gaps in my own understanding, and am willing to adapt to new ways of working. Throughout my career I have consistently sought new learning opportunities; for example, I have never formally studied any aspects of film making, I learned by doing; while I gained initial training in editing and camera operating from a volunteer position in Glasgow, my editing skills were primarily learned on the job, and further honed from listening to feedback from peers and mentors.  

Additionally, over the years I have taught myself motion graphics techniques as well as sound design and basic music composition.  

However, no one learns in a vacuum, and I recognise that I gained an enormous amount from a strong network of peers and mentors; I also have experience of having been a mentor to a younger colleague while at Republic Productions, and I grew personally and professionally from that experience also.  

Aside from my creative skillset, I have a strong technical skillset from my prior experience working in IT. For instance, throughout my video editing career I actively integrated coding into workflows; I have written fairly complex JavaScript expressions in After Effects; I have written Python in Blender 3D to create and animate 3D objects; and I have written Bash scripts to generate disk usage reports on a RAID storage network while at Speakeasy Productions.  

My role at Republic Productions involved maintaining the IT systems of the company; I managed a small network of Windows machines, remotely installing upgrades and security patches. At Speakeasy Productions I was involved in gaining Cyber Essentials certification.  


### Storytelling
Having edited professionally for 20 years, I am a highly adaptable editor with a flexible approach, and I have a huge range of experience across various genres and formats: [long form documentary](OceansofValue); [drama](KentCountyCouncil-FraudandFinancialAbuse); [event opening films](Newton2021-Eventopeningfilm); [bespoke technical presentations](NewtonPresentation2024-Jason); and [monthly magazine-style reportage](LBG-CustomerFirsttv-Risk).  

I feel I have a strength for cutting interviews; when the material allows, I endeavour to intercut the participants in such a way that they seamlessly flow from one speaker to the next; for instance, a transcript of [this video](NESMobileSkillsUnitTestimonial) might read as though only one person was speaking throughout, which is appropriate given that all the speakers give equally effusive praise of the MSU service.  

I am also experienced at cutting promos where the emphasis is on the interplay of the visuals and the music; [this event opening film for Scottish Enterprise](SE_MakingScotlandsFuture_complete) has examples of [cutting to different shots on the beat](SE_MakingScotlandsFuture_music_cut), and also having the beat [synchronise with the action](SE_MakingScotlandsFuture_action_beat_match) of some shots. The video is also a good example of integrating graphics done by an external motion graphics artists, with the animated light paths provided by them, and the picture scaling effect synchronised with the beat done by me.

[This video for Napier University](Coghmear), part of a series of 25 case studies, has simple but effective on brand graphics; these were done collaboratively with the client, who selected the phrases to pull out from an initial version of the video, and I then created the animation in After Effects according to the brand guidelines.  

I also take great pride in sound and music editing. [This video](BereavementA&E_complete) for the NHS, recorded over Teams during the pandemic to inform the NHS workforce about workplace bereavement, has creative use of sound and music, inluding [reversed music to create an unsettling feeling](BereavementA&E) and music [used as a sound effect, to punctuate a particular moment](BereavementA&E_doors). Also, I altered [this piece of music](PrisonSentencing) with an alternative synthesiser, rather than replacing the piece entirely, when one of my colleagues didn't like the original track.  


### Team working  
I have strong written and speaking communication skills and am always conscious of my audience and their level of technical expertise.  

Having made videos for a variety of clients from different industries and sectors, I have demonstrated a strong ability to quickly absorb and understand information relating to subjects where I have limited or non-specialist knowledge. Because of this, I feel I am particularly capable of distilling and communicating complex information to wide audiences.  

Additionally, an essential part of the role of an editor is listening to and implementing feedback from clients, team members and other stakeholders, which has taught me the value of listening to all contributions.  

In my previous role at Speakeasy Productions, and also from my time as a software developer at Agilent in Germany, I have gained valuable experience working across multi-disciplinary teams, and in teams with colleagues whose first language wasn't English. In particular, at Agilent each member of my development team took turns to host our team meetings, which required clear communication, patient and respectful interactions with colleagues, and encouraged me to express ideas using jargon-free language. I also on occasion hosted these meetings in German.  

## Summary

I believe I would be a good fit for Baillie Gifford; I am highly motivated, adaptable, and eager to continue growing in my career. I thrive in supportive, collaborative team environments where the work is both varied and challenging, and I aspire to be a supportive, positive colleague.
