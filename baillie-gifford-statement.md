# Profile from Radial Recruitment CV (2019)  

## A word from the candidate...
I am very interested in the role of Video Editor at Baillie Gifford and I would be delighted to be offered the opportunity to undertake such a role. I believe I have an excellent skill set, particularly due to my experience working with financial clients.  

My video career started as a director and producer; over the years I realised my talents and skills are most suited to editing, and as such I've been editing almost solely for the last ten years, first for Republic Productions and latterly for Speakeasy Productions. I love editing, crafting stories and images from the raw material and I would be extremely interested in doing this type of work for Baillie Gifford. Aside from picture editing, I enjoy the music and sound aspects of the process; I love choosing music that enhances the content. I also enjoy collaborating with others; the variety of work in my role at Speakeasy has often required me to work with a motion graphics artist, and I believe one of my strengths is working with other artists and designers, specifying particular durations and formats for animated titles and so on.  

Cutting interview content, distilling an answer down to the essentials without sacrificing the speaker's intentions or distorting their natural speaking style is a key strength of mine. I am also a skilled promo editor with many years’ experience working to tight deadlines, creating content for clients such as Lloyds Banking Group, Diageo and Newton Investment Management, among many others. I have a wealth of experience in all major camera formats and I've also created a huge variety of content for all the major social media platforms. I have lots of experience of dealing with iPhone and iPad footage for Lloyds Banking Group, who often shoot material themselves and send it to Speakeasy to edit.  

I am fast, efficient and more than capable of working on my own on a specific brief or generating my own content. I am also highly experienced in collaborating side by side with a producer/director, and I have considerable experience of editing with clients.  

Baillie Gifford are known for having socially responsible values and culture. I have been aware of their association with the Edinburgh Science and Book Festivals for many years. Personally, I am keen to advance my career at such a forward thinking and dynamic organisation, and I am excited about the opportunity of working in a tight knit creative video department within the company.  

## Third person bit...
Peter is a skilled editor with over 15 years of studio experience. For the past 5 years he has been working with Speakeasy Productions and leading on all editing. This agency experience has exposed him to a whole host of different clients, projects and challenges and he has gained excellent experience working with financial clients. Having worked in a fast-paced environment, Peter’s ability to work to tight deadlines and overcoming challenging briefs are second to none. Having worked for clients such as Bank of Scotland, he has a great understanding of the type of work that would be required of him at Baillie Gifford and his video editing skills would be highly suitable for this role.  

His skillset is particularly focussed on the technical aspect of editing; with a background in IT Peter is quite the expert when it comes to software. He is experienced in AfterEffects, PremierPro and FinalCut Pro. He is used to working with producers / directors and is well versed in giving advice and input in terms of postproduction from a shooting point of view. Additionally, when it comes to clients, Peter has frequent face to face contact and ensures that their briefs are met to the highest level of quality, on time and on budget. I believe with the skills and experience that Peter has he would be able hit the ground running and after meeting Peter I can confirm he would build relationships easily and communicate with internal stakeholders with ease.  

All in all, Peter is a well-rounded likeable candidate with excellent skills in Video / Film editing. Peter has a strong technical skill set, would be able to work at pace with precision. I was very impressed by Peter when we met – excellent experience in video editing, lots of client experience and genuinely a lovely person. I would highly recommend you meet him if you are keen to get someone in who will very quickly get up to speed.

# Profile from National Records Scotland IT application (2025)  
## About me  

I am an experienced video editor looking to transition back into software development. I am seeking a role in an organisation that will offer me development opportunities and career progression, and I believe National Records of Scotland will give me those opportunities.

## Experience / Technical and Professional skills  

I have been a filmmaker for over twenty years, initially as a freelancer, producing and directing music videos and documentaries for music industry clients; from 2008 until 2024 I was a full-time in-house agency editor, where I primarily worked on corporate communications for both public and private sector clients such as the NHS, Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise, Lloyds Banking Group, Edinburgh University, Newton Investment Management, among many others. (In fact, I edited the New Register House Tour video [http://bit.ly/44XjWKt] for National Records of Scotland while I worked at Speakeasy Productions).

Prior to my career as a filmmaker I worked as a software developer for Agilent Technologies in Germany, from January 2000 until the end of December 2001, where I was part of a five-person team developing in-house HR systems for the 48,000-strong Agilent workforce.
In particular, I was responsible for designing and writing a web frontend to an Oracle database using ASP and JavaScript, allowing any employee worldwide to enter their timesheet data using any workstation.
In addition to developing new systems, I also contributed to the maintenance of the service as a whole; I wrote Bash scripts to automate feature deployment, SQL queries to investigate database issues, and in collaboration with my team I supported ad hoc user issues, keeping the system functioning as much as possible, and available to users in different time zones.

Throughout my video editing career I actively integrated coding into workflows; I automated motion graphics in After Effects with JavaScript; I wrote Python scripts in Blender 3D to generate objects and motion paths; and I wrote simple Bash scripts to help maintain a 70TB Linux-based RAID storage network.
My role at Republic Productions involved maintaining the IT systems of the company; I managed a small network of Windows machines, remotely installing upgrades and security patches. At Speakeasy Productions I was involved in gaining Cyber Essentials certification.

In my spare time I have taught myself various technologies and systems: simple 2D games and simulations with C# (using the .NET MonoGame framework) and Processing (Java); low level programming with C/C++ (primarily using the classic K&R book in a Linux environment); I have extensive experience of all major operating systems, and have experience of shell programming in both Windows and Linux environments with Bash and PowerShell; I am proficient in SQL, and have some experience with SQL Server, PostgreSQL and SQLite for personal projects. Also in a personal capacity I have some experience with Microsoft Azure, as well as exposure to Docker. I am experienced with version control and backup using Git and GitHub.

My GitHub page has some personal projects that demonstrate my passion for learning new languages and technologies.
My [PowerShell Get-Size cmdlet](http://bit.ly/3GVMzja) demonstrates my shell scripting capabilities; in addition to the cmdlet functionality itself, it is thoroughly documented with clear, well-written technical prose, conforming to the Microsoft technical standards for PowerShell documentation.
My implementation of the classic [Pong game in C#](http://bit.ly/4o5z3ue) demonstrates my object-oriented programming capabilities, with well crafted, clearly documented code.
My [Algorithms and Data Structures repository](http://bit.ly/4nWSm8G) demonstrates my ability to solve problems in various programming languages, including C# and JavaScript; in addition, I used [unit testing](http://bit.ly/46PQAQI) to test some of the code.


## Behaviours  
### Developing self and others  

I am comfortable identifying knowledge gaps in my own understanding, and am willing to adapt to new ways of working. Throughout my career I have consistently sought new learning opportunities; for example, I have never formally studied film making, I learned by doing; my editing skills were learned on the job, and further honed from listening to feedback from peers and mentors.
Additionally, I taught myself motion graphics techniques as well as sound design and music composition.
However, no one learns in a vacuum, and I recognise that I gained an enormous amount from a strong network of peers and mentors; I also have experience of having been a mentor to a younger colleague, and I grew personally and professionally from that experience also.

### Communicating and influencing / Working together  

I have strong written and speaking communication skills and am always conscious of my audience and their level of technical expertise.
Having made videos for a variety of clients from different industries and sectors, I have demonstrated a strong ability to quickly absorb and understand information relating to subjects where I have limited or non-specialist knowledge. Because of this, I feel I am particularly capable of distilling and communicating complex information to wide audiences.
Additionally, an essential part of my role as an editor was listening to and implementing feedback from clients, team members and other stakeholders, which taught me the value of listening to all contributions.
In my previous role at Speakeasy Productions, and also from my time as a developer at Agilent in Germany, I have gained valuable experience working across multi-disciplinary teams, and in teams with colleagues whose first language wasn't English. In particular, at Agilent I hosted team meetings, occasionally in German, which required clear communication, patient and respectful interactions with colleagues, and encouraged me to express ideas using jargon-free language.

## Summary  

I believe I would be a good fit for National Records of Scotland; I am highly motivated, adaptable, and eager to learn new technologies. I thrive in supportive, collaborative team environments where the work is both varied and challenging, and aspire to be a supportive, positive colleague.
From my experience of editing the tour video I gained a good understanding of the importance of the National Records of Scotland, and I would consider it a privilege to work for such an organisation.
