## About me

I am an experienced video editor looking to make a transition back into software development. I am seeking a role in an organisation that will offer me development opportunities and career progression. 
I have been a filmmaker for over twenty years, and since 2008 I have been a fulltime editor. I have primarily worked on corporate communications for both public and private sector clients such as NHS, Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise, Lloyds Banking Group, Edinburgh University, Newton Investment Management, among many others. (In fact, I edited the New Register House Tour video for National Records of Scotland while I worked at Speakeasy Productions).  
### Experience  
Prior to my career as an editor I worked as a software developer for Agilent Technologies in Stuttgart, Germany for two years, from January 2000 until the end of December 2001, where I worked as part of a five person team developing payroll systems for the various geographies that were part of the 48,000 Agilent workforce.  
In particular, I was responsible for writing a web frontend to a Unix-hosted Oracle database using ASP and JavaScript, allowing any employee worldwide to enter their timesheet data using any workstation.  
In addition to developing new systems, I also contributed to the maintenance of the payroll service as a whole; I wrote simple Bash shell scripts to automate feature deployment, SQL queries to investigate database issues, and in collaboration with my team I supported ad hoc user issues.  

Throughout my video editing career I actively integrated coding into workflows, automating motion graphics in After Effects with JavaScript, generating objects and motion paths in Blender 3D using Python, and maintaining a Linux-based RAID storage network with simple Bash scripts.  
In my spare time I have taught myself various technologies and systems: making simple 2D games and simulations with C# (using the dotnet Monogame framework) and Processing (Java); low level programming with C/C++ (using the classic K&R book in a Linux environment); I have extensive experience of all major operating systems, and have experience of shell programming in both Windows and Linux environments with Bash and PowerShell; I am also experienced with version control and backup using git and GitHub.  

`More here about my personal projects; include some links to GitHub. Specifically mention my testing awareness with respect to the C++ code; my experience of documentation and delivery with the PowerShell module; anything else I can think of that would be relevant.`  





`does this belong here or at the end?`
>I am highly motivated and thrive in an environment where the work is both challenging and varied.  
>I am accustomed to working on multiple projects simultaneously, often in a fast-paced environment working to tight deadlines, and can prioritise tasks and manage my time effectively.  

## Communication and influencing
My experience as an editor has honed my communication skills, parts" is crap). As an editor I also created motion graphics and animations to explain and illustrate information in engaging ways. Because of this, I feel that I have a particular understanding of how to communicate concisely and clearly, accessible to non-specialists.

Having made videos for a variety of clients from different industries and sectors, I have demonstrated a strong ability to quickly absorb and understand information relating to subjects where I have limited or non-specialist knowledge. Because of this, I feel I am particularly capable of distilling and communicating complex information in to wide audiences.
I have strong written and speaking communication skills and am always conscious of my audience and their level of technical expertise.
In my previous role, and especially from my time at Agilent in Germany, I have gained extensive experience working across multi-disciplinary teams, and in teams with colleagues whose first language wasn't English. At Agilent I hosted team meetings, occasionally in German, which gave me a strong understanding of how to communicate simply and clearly.

## Developing self and others

## scratch - use these sentences as needed 
#### communicating and influencing
My role as an editor has given me years of experience at reflecting on client/customer feedback.  


#### user focus
This is directly analogous to my experience as an editor, working on specific client briefs.  
I have direct experience of managing clients' youtube channels and monitoring the various viewing metrics.  

#### security
At Speakeasy I was involved in the process of attaining Cyber Essentials certification.  
Whilst I have little direct experience of this, I have awareness of the issues surrounding cyber security, having been involved in the process of attaining Cyber Essentials certification at my previous employer.  

#### developing self and others
I have a strong commitment to continuous improvement and seek to learn from my colleagues and, where possible, to be an example to others.  




I am highly motivated, adaptable, and eager to learn new technologies. I thrive in supportive, collaborative team environments where the work is both varied and challenging, and aspire to be a
supportive, positive colleague. I constantly strive to achieve the best results possible in my work. I am a fast learner with excellent communication and interpersonal skills, and am strongly motivated to continue learning and growing in my career.

I would value the opportunity to begin a new chapter in my career with National Records of Scotland, and I believe my age, life experience and creative problem solving expertise would be a valuable asset to the organisation.


### Fiona-specific - can use but need to change
I am committed to following best practice and strive to produce well-crafted, rigorously tested, and clearly documented code.  


I have a passion for learning and development.  
Within my team, I play an active role in researching, designing and developing technical solutions, as well as undertaking investigations that feed into future developments or inform system improvements.  





For instance, in previous roles working alongside research scientists, I translated often complex, highly specialist scientific specifications into technical solutions.  
This two-way process demanded clear communication, patience, and frequent feedback.  


My technical experience spans a range of languages and frameworks, including C#/.NET, JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS, Python, Django, FastAPI, with some exposure to Angular and React. I also have extensive experience with cloud platforms and DevOps technologies, including Microsoft Azure, AWS, Docker, Docker Compose and Kubernetes. I have a sound understanding of software design principles and patterns, such as MVC. I am flexible, adaptable, and always open to learning new skills as required by whatever project I am working on.
I believe that the mix of skills and experience I have gained over the course of my career, particularly as a developer with the TP&QM team, make me an ideal fit for this role.


WHY National Records of Scotland
Throughout my career, I have worked for a number of different organisations across a range of industry sectors.  
In recent years, having reflected on my own values and priorities, I have come to place an increasingly high importance on working within a field that reflects what is important to me and what I value.
