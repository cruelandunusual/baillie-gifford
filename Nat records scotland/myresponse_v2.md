## About me

I am an experienced video editor looking to make a transition back into software development. I am seeking a role in an organisation that will offer me development opportunities and career progression. 
I have been a filmmaker for over twenty years, initially as a freelancer, producing and directing music videos and documentaries for music industry clients; from 2008 until 2024 I was a fulltime inhouse agency editor, where I primarily worked on corporate communications for both public and private sector clients such as the NHS, Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise, Lloyds Banking Group, Edinburgh University, Newton Investment Management, among many others. (In fact, I edited the New Register House Tour video for National Records of Scotland while I worked at Speakeasy Productions).  

### Experience  

Prior to my career as an editor I worked as a software developer for Agilent Technologies in Stuttgart, Germany for two years, from January 2000 until the end of December 2001, where I worked as part of a five person team developing payroll systems for the various geographies that were part of the 48,000 Agilent workforce.  
In particular, I was responsible for writing a web frontend to a Unix-hosted Oracle database using ASP and JavaScript, allowing any employee worldwide to enter their timesheet data using any workstation.  
In addition to developing new systems, I also contributed to the maintenance of the payroll service as a whole; I wrote simple Bash scripts to automate feature deployment, SQL queries to investigate database issues, and in collaboration with my team I supported ad hoc user issues, keeping the system functioning as much as possible, and available to users in different time zones.

Throughout my video editing career I actively integrated coding into workflows; I automated motion graphics in After Effects with JavaScript; I wrote Python scripts in Blender 3D to generate objects and motion paths; and I wrote simple Bash scripts to help maintain a 70TB Linux-based RAID storage network.
In my spare time I have taught myself various technologies and systems: making simple 2D games and simulations with C# (using the .NET XNA/Monogame framework) and Processing (Java); low level programming with C/C++ (using the classic K&R book in a Linux environment); I have extensive experience of all major operating systems, and have experience of shell programming in both Windows and Linux environments with Bash and PowerShell; I am also experienced with version control and backup using Git and GitHub.  
My role at Republic Productions involved maintaining the IT systems of the company; I managed a small network of Windows machines, remotely installing upgrades and security patches. At Speakeasy Productions I was involved with the wider team in gaining Cyber Essentials certification.   

`More here about my personal projects; include some links to GitHub. Specifically mention my testing awareness with respect to the C++ code; my experience of documentation and delivery with the PowerShell module; anything else I can think of that would be relevant.`  

### Developing self and others

I am comfortable identifying knowledge gaps in my own understanding, and am willing to adapt to new ways of working. Throughout my career I have consistently sought new learning opportunities; for instance, I never formally studied filmmaking, I learned by doing; my editing skills were learned on the job, and further honed from listening to feedback from peers and mentors. Additionally, I taught myself motion graphics techniques as well as sound design and music composition. I recognise that I learned and developed from a strong network of peers and mentors; I also have experience of having been a mentor to a younger colleague, and I gained enormously from that experience also.



### Communication and influencing and Working together

I have strong written and speaking communication skills and am always conscious of my audience and their level of technical expertise.
Having made videos for a variety of clients from different industries and sectors, I have demonstrated a strong ability to quickly absorb and understand information relating to subjects where I have limited or non-specialist knowledge. Because of this, I feel I am particularly capable of distilling and communicating complex information to wide audiences. 
Additionally, an essential part of my role as an editor was listening to and implementing feedback from clients, team members and other stakeholders, which taught me the value of listening to all contributions.
In my previous role at Speakeasy Productions, and also from my time as a developer at Agilent in Germany, I have gained extensive experience working across multi-disciplinary teams, and in teams with colleagues whose first language wasn't English. At Agilent I hosted team meetings, occasionally in German, which required clear communication, patient and respectful interactions with colleagues, and encouraged me to express ideas using jargon-free language.

## ENDING
I am highly motivated, adaptable, and eager to learn new technologies. I thrive in supportive, collaborative team environments where the work is both varied and challenging, and aspire to be a
supportive, positive colleague. I constantly strive to achieve the best results possible in my work. I am a fast learner with excellent communication and interpersonal skills, and am strongly motivated to continue learning and growing in my career.

### developing self and others
### mentoring
I have a strong commitment to continuous improvement and seek to learn from my colleagues and, where possible, to be an example to others.  
I am lucky to have benefited enormously from my peers and mentors. I recognise that I learned and developed in ways that wouldn't have been possible on my own. Aside from having been mentored, I have experience of being a mentor to a younger colleague, and I gained enormously from that experience also.



I would value the opportunity to begin a new chapter in my career with National Records of Scotland, and I believe my age, life experience and creative problem solving expertise would be a valuable asset to the organisation.

### Fiona-specific - can use but need to change
I am committed to following best practice and strive to produce well-crafted, rigorously tested, and clearly documented code.  





My technical experience spans a range of languages and frameworks, including C#/.NET, JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS, Python, Django, FastAPI, with some exposure to Angular and React. I also have extensive experience with cloud platforms and DevOps technologies, including Microsoft Azure, AWS, Docker, Docker Compose and Kubernetes. I have a sound understanding of software design principles and patterns, such as MVC. I am flexible, adaptable, and always open to learning new skills as required by whatever project I am working on.
I believe that the mix of skills and experience I have gained over the course of my career, particularly as a developer with the TP&QM team, make me an ideal fit for this role.


WHY National Records of Scotland
Throughout my career, I have worked for a number of different organisations across a range of industry sectors.  
In recent years, having reflected on my own values and priorities, I have come to place an increasingly high importance on working within a field that reflects what is important to me and what I value.
