Take each editing “ability” in the job description and show how I meet it.   
Link to specific bits of videos to illustrate, e.g. terms and conditions of newton videos.  
Strong examples of:

* Sound (sfx from an animation?)  
* Graphics (not sure what to use here) NHS dummy film? Possibly even do something specifically for the application? Newton videos from Oct 2025  
* Music (prisons film, national records of Scotland)  
* Interview editing (community service, a Napier film)

Also stories of me filming, recording sound, location scouting, to show how adaptable I am. Scripting some basic bash for the backups.  
All the stuff in the national records application about doing meetings in German and how it shows respect for colleagues. Mentoring and being mentored.
