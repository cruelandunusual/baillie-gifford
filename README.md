        This was recut in a single night from the original brief as the client didn't like the treatment.

    * [Scottish Enterprise - Making Scotland's Future](https://youtu.be/RAalmdrNasE?si=rzUqfE_HoayaK_4x&t=43) _(matching the cuts to the beat)_  
        Standard cutting from shot to shot on the beat of the track.
    * [Scottish Enterprise - Making Scotland's Future](https://youtu.be/RAalmdrNasE?si=tRd2PAsa6_ph4c9k&t=51) _(matching the action of the shot to the beat)_  
        The robot arm in this shot has been retimed so that its staccato movements are timed with the beat of the track.

* #### _Creative use of music and audio_
    * [NHS Education for Scotland - Bereavement in the A&E](https://youtu.be/s7G6mfRpoCU?si=8-2eFVx4lMFJgNlG&t=231) _(starts at 03:51)_  
    The section of the video that begins at 03:51 has reversed music to create an unsettling feeling.
    * [NHS Education for Scotland - Bereavement in the A&E](https://youtu.be/s7G6mfRpoCU?si=h7mCs0CxmZIC8Cp8&t=470) _(starts at 07:50)_  
    The section of the video at 07:50 has music used both as background and coming to the fore as a sound effect to punctuate the nurse's story.
    * [Scottish Courts and Tribunal Services - Prison Sentencing](https://youtu.be/8ikps64ec3I?si=H2hRTtyFH2XLLq_2&t=139) _(starts at 02:19)_  
    I altered the Audio Network music in the section that begins at 02:19 with an alternative synthesiser from Ableton Live rather than replacing the piece entirely, when one of my colleagues didn't like the original track.

### Interesting early career work
