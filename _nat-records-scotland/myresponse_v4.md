## About me

I am an experienced video editor looking to transition back into software development. I am seeking a role in an organisation that will offer me development opportunities and career progression, and I believe National Records of Scotland will give me those opportunities.  

## Experience / Technical and Professional skills 
I have been a filmmaker for over twenty years, initially as a freelancer, producing and directing music videos and documentaries for music industry clients; from 2008 until 2024 I was a full-time in-house agency editor, where I primarily worked on corporate communications for both public and private sector clients such as the NHS, Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise, Lloyds Banking Group, Edinburgh University, Newton Investment Management, among many others. (In fact, I edited the `New Register House Tour` video for National Records of Scotland while I worked at Speakeasy Productions).  

Prior to my career as a video editor I worked as a software developer for Agilent Technologies in Stuttgart, Germany, from January 2000 until the end of December 2001, where I worked as part of a five-person team developing in-house payroll systems for the various geographies that were part of the 48,000 Agilent workforce.  
In particular, I was responsible for designing and writing a web frontend to a Unix-hosted Oracle database using ASP and JavaScript, allowing any employee worldwide to enter their timesheet data using any workstation.  
In addition to developing new systems, I also contributed to the maintenance of the payroll service as a whole; I wrote Bash scripts to automate feature deployment, SQL queries to investigate database issues, and in collaboration with my team I supported ad hoc user issues, keeping the system functioning as much as possible, and available to users in different time zones.  

Throughout my video editing career I actively integrated coding into workflows; I automated motion graphics in After Effects with JavaScript; I wrote Python scripts in Blender 3D to generate objects and motion paths; and I wrote simple Bash scripts to help maintain a 70TB Linux-based RAID storage network.  
My role at Republic Productions involved maintaining the IT systems of the company; I managed a small network of Windows machines, remotely installing upgrades and security patches. At Speakeasy Productions I was involved with the wider team in gaining Cyber Essentials certification.  

In my spare time I have taught myself various technologies and systems: simple 2D games and simulations with C# (using the .NET XNA/Monogame framework) and Processing (Java); low level programming with C/C++ (primarily using the classic K&R book in a Linux environment); I have extensive experience of all major operating systems, and have experience of shell programming in both Windows and Linux environments with Bash and PowerShell; I am proficient in SQL, and have some experience with SQL Server, PostgreSQL and SQLite for personal projects. Also in a personal capacity I have some experience with Microsoft Azure, as well as some exposure to Docker. I am experienced with version control and backup using Git and GitHub.  

My GitHub page has some personal projects that demonstrate my passion for learning new languages and technologies.  
My `PowerShell Get-Size` module demonstrates my shell scripting capabilities; in addition to the module functionality itself, it is thoroughly documented with clear, well-written technical prose, conforming to the Microsoft technical standards for PowerShell documentation.
My implementation of the classic `Pong game in C#` demonstrates my object-oriented programming capabilities, with well crafted, clearly documented code.
My `leetcode repository` demonstrates an understanding of algorithms and data structures, as well as `unit testing`.


## Behaviours  
### Developing self and others

I am comfortable identifying knowledge gaps in my own understanding, and am willing to adapt to new ways of working. Throughout my career I have consistently sought new learning opportunities; for example, I have never formally studied film making, I learned by doing; my editing skills were learned on the job, and further honed from listening to feedback from peers and mentors. Additionally, I taught myself motion graphics techniques as well as sound design and music composition. However, no one learns in a vacuum, and I recognise that I gained an enormous amount from a strong network of peers and mentors; I also have experience of having been a mentor to a younger colleague, and I grew personally and professionally from that experience also.

### Communicating and influencing / Working together

I have strong written and speaking communication skills and am always conscious of my audience and their level of technical expertise.
Having made videos for a variety of clients from different industries and sectors, I have demonstrated a strong ability to quickly absorb and understand information relating to subjects where I have limited or non-specialist knowledge. Because of this, I feel I am particularly capable of distilling and communicating complex information to wide audiences. 
Additionally, an essential part of my role as an editor was listening to and implementing feedback from clients, team members and other stakeholders, which taught me the value of listening to all contributions.
In my previous role at Speakeasy Productions, and also from my time as a developer at Agilent in Germany, I have gained valuable experience working across multi-disciplinary teams, and in teams with colleagues whose first language wasn't English. In particular, at Agilent I hosted team meetings, occasionally in German, which required clear communication, patient and respectful interactions with colleagues, and encouraged me to express ideas using jargon-free language.

## Summary
I believe that the mix of skills and experience I have gained over the course of my career make me an ideal fit for this role.
I believe I would be a good fit for National Records of Scotland; I am highly motivated, adaptable, and eager to learn new technologies. I thrive in supportive, collaborative team environments where the work is both varied and challenging, and aspire to be a supportive, positive colleague. From my experience of editing the tour video I gained a good understanding of the importance of what the National Records of Scotland does, and I would consider it a privilege to work for such an organisation.
