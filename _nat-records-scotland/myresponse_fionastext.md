WHY I AM GOOD
I am an experienced software developer with a passion for learning and development.  
I am committed to following best practice and strive to produce well-crafted, rigorously tested, and clearly documented code.  
I am highly motivated and thrive in an environment where the work is both challenging and varied.  
I have a strong commitment to continuous improvement and seek to learn from my colleagues and, where possible, to be an example to others.  

As an existing member of the TP&QM delivery team, I am responsible for developing and maintaining several large-scale, technically complex applications. I work closely with Product Owners, fellow developers, and testers to define and refine stakeholder requirements, translating these into technical solutions.  
I am accustomed to working on multiple projects simultaneously, often in a fast-paced environment working to tight deadlines, and can prioritise tasks and manage my time effectively.  
Within my team, I play an active role in researching, designing and developing technical solutions, as well as undertaking investigations that feed into future developments or inform system improvements.  
In addition, I proactively contribute to ongoing efforts to improve and increase the documentation and automated testing of our numerous applications.  
In my current role, and over the course of my career, I have gained extensive experience working across multi-disciplinary teams, and across international teams where language differences have been a factor.  
I have strong communication skills and am always conscious of my audience and their level of technical expertise.  
Where necessary, I endeavour to communicate technical information in a way that is concise, jargon-free, and accessible to non-specialists.  
This ability has been crucial not only in my work as an IT professional, but also as a tutor where I frequently taught programming skills to students from non-technical backgrounds, including Arts & Humanities students.  

Communication is a two-way street, and having worked across various industry sectors, I have demonstrated a strong ability to quickly absorb and understand information relating to subjects where I have limited or non-specialist knowledge.  
For instance, in previous roles working alongside research scientists, I translated often complex, highly specialist scientific specifications into technical solutions.  
This two-way process demanded clear communication, patience, and frequent feedback.  

My technical experience spans a range of languages and frameworks, including C#/.NET, JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS, Python, Django, FastAPI, with some exposure to Angular and React. I also have extensive experience with cloud platforms and DevOps technologies, including Microsoft Azure, AWS, Docker, Docker Compose and Kubernetes. I have a sound understanding of software design principles and patterns, such as MVC. I am flexible, adaptable, and always open to learning new skills as required by whatever project I am working on.
I believe that the mix of skills and experience I have gained over the course of my career, particularly as a developer with the TP&QM team, make me an ideal fit for this role.


WHY National Records of Scotland
Throughout my career in IT, I have worked for a number of different organisations across a range of industry sectors.  
In recent years, having reflected on my own values and priorities, I have come to place an increasingly high importance on working within a field that reflects what is important to me and what I value.  

I am a strong believer in public sector healthcare and, in common with most people, have a deep respect for healthcare professionals, particularly given the events of the last few years and my own personal experience of providing care for sick and elderly relatives.  

Having worked for the NHS over the last two years, I appreciate the importance of the work we do and the contribution we make to the delivery of high-quality healthcare. Moreover, I feel privileged to work in an organisation that genuinely lives its values, and to work with a group of people who daily demonstrate kindness, support, and respect.
